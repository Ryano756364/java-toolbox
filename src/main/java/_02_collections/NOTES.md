# Collections Notes

- No third party API required when working with collections
- No need to create API from handling collection objects
- Collections framework is tested and optimized

List Types
- ArrayList
  - Fast and easy to access any element from any location
  - Operations are slow and tends to use more memory 
  - Java needs to create new ArrayList if an element is removed
- LinkedList
- Stack
  - Think of stack of books
  - LIFO list
  - operations are performed on the top first
  - empty, peek, pop, push, search (returns position)
  - extends vector class
- Vector (very rarely used)
  - synchronized where ArrayList is not
